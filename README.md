## Overview


 * Here is a link to the live demo: https://customey.onrender.com/

 * This is a clone of the popular e-commerce site Etsy. 

 * A few things I learned:
    * How AWS S3 integration is implemented
    * A better way to create and store shopping cart data in a database.

 * A few skills I improved upon: 
   * Reusing components for more than on purpose. Many forms were used for both editing and creating data. 
   * Database design. My implementation of the shopping cart in the database was sub-optimal and I've now got a better idea on ways to implement one that are more efficient and easier to work with.
